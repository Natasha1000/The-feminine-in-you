		<p class="text2">My name is Natasha I am from the south coast of England and I have been exploring my feminine side since I was a young child, my earliest memory being 10/11 years old trying on nylons and a nice pleated skirt and I remember vividly the intoxicating feeling it gave me.</p>
		<p class="text2">Over the years I have learnt many things, one being that “what you resist persists” and that has certainly been the case throughout my life. At many given times I have tried to forget or suppress my desire to wear female attire only for the feeling to come back stronger. I have finally made peace with the fact that I believe my spirit is looking to express itself and I cannot ignore the desires to express the feminine in me.</p>
		<p class="text2">I also understand that people have different relationships with dressing in the opposing genders clothing. For me I have occupied many different label s over the years and I think that these change in line with your awareness of who you are and what you really want.</p>
		<p class="text2">I want to create a place where people can feel positive and happy to be able to express this wonderful and sacred part of them, and this is my first step into reaching out there and offering my help and service where needed.</p>
