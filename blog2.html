	<h2>Blog #2 My Routine</h2>
	<p>1st October 2019</p>	
	<br> <br>
	<p>I have always loved what can be achieved with makeup on both men and women and it is I feel an art form that is limitless in its scope with new products and techniques always arising.</p>
	<p>My first encounters with makeup would be like most people’s I guess, a bit of lipstick and eye shadow to start with.  How far I have come since then but I acknowledge there is still so much I could improve upon.</p>
	<p>As T-girls, when looking to take on a totally feminine persona we must first look at what holds us back from achieving our goal or aim and for me it was my eyebrows and stubble.  These were the masculine things I would look to hide or disguise.  Stubble can be shaved and I have always found wet shaves to be the closest, however for longer periods of wearing makeup stubble may re-emerge and so there are methods by which we can conceal this symbol of manliness a little longer (colour corrector).  I am now just starting facial electrolysis but I have up until this point had many years of working on concealing stubble and I feel I have a good method which I will explain further below in my routine description.</p>
	<p>Eyebrows at one time were the bane of my life as I had unfortunately thick ones, once upon a time.  My first attempt at coverage was with Kryolan gum but I never got on with it, it may have been down to my lack of ability but I then moved onto using Magic Pritt Stick as I had seen many tutorials of Drag Queens successfully using it.  A few years ago I took the plunge and thinned out my eyebrows severely which although is strange if I present in male it looks so much better than concealing like I used to for all those years.  I guess it’s a judgment call if you can tolerate the new look in male for the payoff.  For me it is much better but in my earlier years I would have been too apprehensive in being called out.  I have come to realise that people don’t really care and I have never had any comments or problems presenting in male with thinner eye brows.
I believe a T-girls relationship is not static but ever evolving and so now I wish to share with you my current routine as of 2019.</p>
	<p>My Routine.....(Overview)....The first thing I do is have a wet shave, and shave as close as I can, going against the grain to get the closer feel.  I tidy my eyebrows with some plucking where necessary, then I heavily moisturise as I have learnt very early on in my journey that if your skin is too dry then the makeup dry too and crack which should be avoided at all costs.</p>
	<p>Once the moisturiser has been fully I then prime my face using a Max Factor Primer.  This is a new process for me which I picked up this year from a makeup course I attended in June.  The purpose is it prepares the skin and increases durability of the makeup.  A little goes a long way.</p>

	<p>I mentioned before I am just at the beginning of having electrolysis and so at this time I still have a lot of stubble to conceal.  This can be achieved by using colour corrector which is determined by your hair colour, so for myself I use an orange lipstick which seems to work.  The idea is it counter the colour you seek to conceal by using a colour which is the opposite of the colour wheel.  This can easily be found online for more information on this via Google.  I use the lipstick on prominent areas, the chin and the top lip.  Next I use a Kryolan Pan stick concealer to give extra thick coverage.  This is a good product for concealing and is used in theatre and film.  Once that is on the stubble I put a liquid foundation over my whole face.  Choosing the right foundation and makeup in general is another story which I will look to do another blog on in future.  I leave the foundation on a while to dry as I apply quite generously, so I normally get something to eat or meditate to pass the time (10-20 minutes).  This has now set the blank canvas on which more colour can be added.</p>
	<p>I then put some translucent powder over all of my face to help set the makeup.  Next I apply highlighter to my forehead, cheek bones, end of nose and chin.  Then using a darker powder than (I use a bronzer), so as to differential from the foundation, I apply this for my contours, this is under my cheeks, the top of my forehead and under the chin and sides of the nose.  Done correctly this is a great way to make your face appear slimmer if that is the desired effect.</p>
	<p>I then apply my blusher to my cheeks whilst pouting.  I apply grey eye shadow to my eye brows to go over and accentuate my eyebrows.  I previously used black but this was too dark and so I moved onto grey.  I apply eye shadow; this is varied as there is so much that can be done on this area.  Next I apply Eye liner and mascara, before applying lip liner and lipstick.  Last of all I give my face a spray with a makeup setting spray (another addition to my routine).</p>
	<p>Well that is an overview of my routine which can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours, and I should qualify that this is an ever evolving process.  The great thing about makeup is there are endless improvements that can be made.
I hope this was helpful and please feel free to drop me a line if you have any questions.</p>
	<p>Bye for now.</p>
