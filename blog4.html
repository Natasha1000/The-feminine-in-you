	<h2>Blog #4 Product Review of the Smoothskin Gold IPL Device</h2>
	<p>Posted on 3rd February 2020</p>
	<br> <br>
	<p>Being naturally hairy can mean a lot of maintenance for us transgender girls, and clearing all areas can be tiresome when done on a near on daily basis.  When I had made peace with the fact I would not be stopping with my quest to be feminine I decided to go down the path of getting rid of all my body hair.  It was a few years ago and a transgender friend of mine who advised she previously had been quite hairy but had been using the Smoothskin Gold and had gotten great results.  I had at that point started to epilate for more lasting results than shaving but this was a painful exercise.  The recommended products full name is:</p>
	<p><b>Smoothskin Gold IPL – IPL device for removal of unwanted body hair.</b></p>
	<p>She recommended it to me and now after having used it for a considerable time I am here to now recommend it myself to any person out there reading this who is interested in body hair removal.
I will start by describing the product how it should be best used and then will give a pros and cons summary to help people get a better idea as to whether this is the product for them.</p>

	<p>Now it is a quite an investment at £330 currently which is what I paid, now although that seems like a lot of money, the way to look at it is how much would you pay for a technician to clear all your body hair at usually £50 per session?  You will find it may well reach the thousands rather than the hundreds.</p>
	<p>In using the device it is advised that you first do a patch test to ensure that all is ok and there are no adverse reactions, and it should be noted that it is only suitable for certain skin tones and it is not recommended for people with very dark skin. 
The device sends little warm 1 second bursts and then you move it around the designated areas.  It is advised to initially do monthly treatments but I have in an effort to clear the remaining few areas have increased my frequency of use more recently.  It is recommended that the device be used to target certain areas at different times as it can be very easy to miss areas in an effort to get through the treatment quickly.</p>
	<p>The Pros of the device are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It does work on permanently removing body hair.</li>
		<li>Cost is cheaper than the alternative in having it done professionally.</li>
		<li>It is easy to use and can be done quite easily whilst relaxing watching television.</li>
		<li>The device has 200,000 + flashes which should be a lot more than is needed to clear all body hair.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Cons of the device are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is not effective on facial hair (For Transgender persons whom have stubble).</li>
		<li>You have to shave the area first, and so further down the line need to use memory to recall where the patches of re-growth will be.</li>
		<li>It is not an overnight process and as face electrolysis can take anything up to 4 years this can take a while and especially as the areas to clear will most probably be vaster.  Patience and persistence is needed.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In summary, I have been using the device for over a year / 2 years in monthly intervals, and there has been definite clearance with only patches here and there.  I had very dense hair and so believe it is a very effective tool for hair removal.   The cons above become irrelevant if you want hair removal as any route you take will require time and investment and so I am pleased to have purchased this device and happily recommend it to you.</p>
	<p>Please feel free to drop me a line if you have any questions regarding the device or the blog in general.</p>
	<p>Until next time thank you for reading...</p>
