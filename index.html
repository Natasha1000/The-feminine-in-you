<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p style="font-size:1.25rem">It has now been nearly 2 years since the launch of my website I and thought it was due a revamp based on what I have liked about the site and what is appearing to be more useful to people.</p>

</body>

I initially envisioned this site being a place where people could come and get answers to things they want to know and also a place where they could see a possibility in doing or being what they desire to be deep down inside.  I have decided to remove the sale of items for now as I do not believe that this is a great need but will higlight that specific items I do have for sale on my ebay platform.

<p style="font-size:1rem">I had started to get a few blogs created but with the events of 2020 I seemed to have had my attention diverted to other places and additionally a lot has happened in my life since this sites inception.  I want this site to serve a purpose and based on the feedback I have received it is a place that is of use but I must build upon that if it is to be of great service.</p>
