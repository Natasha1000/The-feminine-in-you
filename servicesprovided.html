	<h2>Service for admirers - chat in confidence</h2>
	<p class="text1">Service for admirers (chat in confidence) - I wanted to provide a service for those admirers that want to talk through their thoughts and feelings in a safe and non-judgemental place. This is not counselling but emotional support and guidance in helping you to come to terms with what you may or may not wish to do or be. I have found that in the past some admirers really want to dress but it is not clear to them and talking to someone may help them acknowledge their true inner desire to be feminine. Conversely I offer this service to admirers who simply are attracted to transgender girls and want to talk over there thoughts and feelings, £22 per hour.</p>

	<p class="text1">Clothes storage - Storage of all feminine goods, £19 per month.</p>
